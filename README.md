# V-Isio

## Outline
V-Isio is a standalone application to visualize data on structured grid systems. This application is developed to support several PC environments, MacOSX, Linux, and Windows. Functoins provided are mainly desinged to depict thermal fluid simulation data, especially for FFV-C simulator. V-Isio can handle relatively large dataset owing to its efficient data structure and FFV-C's result files with a meta-data dfi file, which allows us to manage parallel distributed files directly.
